So You Want to Contribute...
============================

For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.

Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with Networking CCloud VXLAN Fabric.

This ml2 driver is tailored to the needs of Converged Cloud, but if you think
it might be useful to your organization your contributions will most likely
be welcome! Note that there are some differences in code-style from normal
OpenStack projects, e.g. we use a max-line-length of 120 and some additional
pep8 exceptions.

Task Tracking

.. This section is about where you track tasks- launchpad? storyboard? is there
