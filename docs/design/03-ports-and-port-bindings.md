# Ports and Port Bindings
An OpenStack port represents a connection between a device (VM NIC, bare metal server NIC, load balancer, router, ...)
and an OpenStack network.

## Port Binding Process
1. Port binding will arrive at `networking-ccloud` aka The Driver
2. The Driver will look at the `host` associated to the port and will decide to which hostgroup it belongs
    * for most ports this is `binding_host_id`
    * for bare metal this is part of the `binding_profile`
    * a hostgroup is generally associated with one leaf pair
3. The Driver will create a network segment (or already have one) in its DB
    * a VLAN id will be chosen from a leaf-pair-local VLAN pool
4. The Driver will call `continue_binding()` and hand over control to the next driver
5. IF this is for a port/device connected directly to the fabric (`direct_mode`) The Driver will handle the final port binding
    * for bare metal it will provide trunk ports


Assuming `$bb` has been bound to `$net_a` with `$vlan_bb`, while `$vni_net_a` the configuration might look like the following:


Config on Arista Leaf:
```
vlan $vlan_bb
!
interface vxlan1
    --- vxlan1 default config omitted here
    vxlan vlan $vlan_bb vni $vni_net_a
    vxlan vrf $L2_VRF vni $L2_VRF_VNI   # in ACI this is currently aci-l2-vrf
!
! for each interface part of this hostgroup
interface $eth_x
    switchport mode trunk
    switchport trunk allowed vlan add $vlan_bb  # only add the vlan
!
bgp $asn_leaf_bb
    vlan $vlan_bb
        rd $leaf_loopback_0
        route-target both $vni_net_a:$vni_net_a
        redistribute learned
        redistribute connected
```
 * We need to know or control `$leaf_loopback_0` per leaf
 * we need to make sure for new interfaces that they have a `switchport trunk allowed vlan` list (by default vlans all are allowed)


Config on NXOS leaf:
```

```


## Bare Metal on Fabric
Bare metal servers are in most cases directly connected to dedicated Arista switches which will become part of our fabric.
With this integration they will be direct-on-fabric devices. This case is similar to the Avocado-Baremetal case
(see 11-avocado.md).

Arista leaf config:
```

```

## Trunk Ports
The Driver will only do special handling for trunk ports that are handled by The Driver itself, e.g. anything The Driver
does the final binding for.
